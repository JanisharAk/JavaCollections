=> HashSet in Java implements the Set interface of Collections Framework.
   It is used to store the unique elements and it doesn't maintain any specific order of elements.

- Can store the Null values.
- Uses HashMap (implementation of hash table data structure) internally.
- Also implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
- HashSet is not thread-safe. So to make it thread-safe, synchronization is needed externally.

Internal Working of a HashSet:-
 All the classes of the Set interface are internally backed up by Map.
 HashSet uses HashMap for storing its object internally. You must be wondering
 that to enter a value in HashMap we need a key-value pair, but in HashSet,
 we are passing only one value.
