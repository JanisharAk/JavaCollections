*   Java ArrayList is a part of the collections framework and it is a class of java.util package.
    It provides us with dynamic-sized arrays in Java.

*   The main advantage of ArrayList is that, unlike normal arrays, we don't need to mention the
    size when creating ArrayList. It automatically adjusts its capacity as elements are added or
    removed.
*   It may be slower than standard arrays, but it is helpful when the size is not known in advance.
    Note that creating a large fixed-sized array would cause a waste of space.
*   Since ArrayList is part of the collections framework, it has better interoperability with
    other collections. For example, conversion to a HashSet is straightforward.
*   With generics, ArrayList<T> ensures type safety at compile-time.

*   Syntax of ArrayList :-
                         ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();

*Some Key Points of ArrayList in Java:-

1. ArrayList is Underlined data Structure Resizable Array or Growable Array.
2. ArrayList Duplicates Are Allowed.
3. Insertion Order is Preserved.
4. Heterogeneous objects are allowed.
5. Null insertion is possible.
