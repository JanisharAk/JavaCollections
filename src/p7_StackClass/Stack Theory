=> The Java Collection framework provides a Stack class, which implements a Stack data structure.
 The class is based on the basic principle of LIFO (last-in-first-out). Besides the basic push
 and pop operations, the class also provides three more functions, such as empty, search, and peek.

=>   The Stack class extends Vector and provides additional functionality for stack operations,
     such as push, pop, peek, empty, and search.
=>   The Stack class can be considered as a subclass of Vector because it inherits all of its
     methods and properties.
