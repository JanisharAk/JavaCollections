=>  The Vector class in Java implements a growable array of objects. Vectors were legacy classes,
    but now it is fully compatible with collections. It comes under java.util package and implement
    the List interface.

* Key Features of Vector:

1. It expands as elements are added.
2. Vector class is synchronized in nature means it is thread-safe by default.
3. Like an ArrayList, it maintains insertion order.
4. It allows duplicates and nulls.
5. It implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, and Serializable.

*  Vector Class Declaration:-
     public class Vector<E> extends AbstractList<E>  implements
                                          List<E>, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable
     Here, E is the type of element.
